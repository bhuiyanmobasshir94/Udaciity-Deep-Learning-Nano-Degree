## Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree 2019

A repo of all projects and course works related to the udacity deep learning nano degree program. This is an extensive program where we have to practice every lesson on their workspace or personal computer.

- As projects are done in udacity work environment (for gpu support) I will gradually upload projects here.

Nano Degree Core Curriculum:
- Introduction to deep learning
- Neural Networks
